# zeroGL
A zero-dependencies, single-header 3D graphics library

<img src="./docs/img/rasterizer.gif" width="500">

## Features

* Single-header library written in C with no external dependencies
* Programmable shaders
* Perspective-correct texture support
* Point/Ambient/Directional lighting
* Materials with specular and diffuse properties
* Camera and backface culling
* z-Buffering
* Load OBJ/MTL files (in separate library)

## Getting started

To use zeroGL in your project, download `zerogl.h` from the releases page and include it in your project. You can find the [documentation here](prcastro.github.io/zeroGL/). To run the demo, download the latest .zip file from the releases page, uncompress it and run.

## Building the demo

Clone this repo with submodules:

```console
$ git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/prcastro/zeroGL.git
```

Before starting, you need to decide whether you are going to use the vendored SDL3 version (in the `external/sdl3` directory) or if you're going to use the system SDL3 you've installed. The following instructions assume you're using the vendored SDL3 distribution. If you want to use the SDL system library, see the instructions [here](#using-a-system-SDL-library).

If you're not using CMake or Zig, you first need to [build SDL3](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/blob/main/docs/README-cmake.md) from the `external/sdl3` directory. If you're using CMake, the `external/sdl3` will build automatically. If you're using Zig as the build system, we're using [castholm/SDL](https://github.com/castholm/SDL) as the SDL dependency, as it provides SDL integration with Zig's build system, so you don't even need to download the `external/sdl3` git submodule.


### Windows

#### CMake
Install Visual Studio Community 2022 (the C/C++ compilers may suffice) and CMake. This is the only option that doesn't require you to pre-build SDL3 before starting. Then, from the command-line run:

```console
> cmake -B build/ -G "Visual Studio 17 2022"

> cmake --build build/ --config Release
```

The binary will be written to build/Release/main.exe

#### Zig

To run the demo, just [install zig](https://ziglang.org/learn/getting-started/#installing-zig) (it's basically downloading a binary and adding it to your path) and then run:

```console
> zig build run --release=fast
```

#### build.bat
Install Visual Studio Community 2022 (the C/C++ compilers may suffice) and then double-click the `build.bat` file. Alternatively, from the command-line run:

```console
> build.bat
```

The binary will be written to build/main.exe


#### Using cl.exe
Install Visual Studio Community 2022 (the C/C++ compilers may suffice), then run:

```console
> "c:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\Community\VC\Auxiliary\Build\vcvarsall.bat" x86_amd64

> cl.exe /Zi /EHsc /O2 /nologo /Fobuild\obj\ /Febuild\main.exe main.c /I external\sdl3\include /link /LIBPATH:external\sdl3\build\RelWithDebInfo SDL3.lib

> copy external\sdl3\build\RelWithDebInfo\SDL3.dll build\SDL3.dll
```

Change the `vcvarsall.bat` path according to your VS installation. The binary will be written to build/Release/main.exe.

#### VS Code
If you're using Visual Studio Code, then you can install Visual Studio Community 2022 (the C/C++ compilers may suffice) and CMake. Also install the C/C++ extensions from Microsoft and the CMake Tools extension as well.

Open `main.c` on the editor and then click on â–¶ on status bar at the bottom.

### Linux

#### GCC

On Linux sytems where SDL3 is installed, the exemple main program can also be built by running (again, ):

```console
gcc main.c -I./external/sdl3/include -Lexternal/sdl3/build/RelWithDebInfo -lSDL3 -lm -o build/main
```

#### Zig

```console
$ zig build run --release=fast
```

### macOS

#### Zig

To run the demo, just [install zig](https://ziglang.org/learn/getting-started/#installing-zig) (it's basically downloading a binary and adding it to your path) and then run:

```console
$ zig build run --release=fast
```

### Using a system SDL library

If you want to use the SDL library installed in your system, make sure you have version v3.2.8 (using `apt` or `brew`) and find the installed libraries. On every instruction, you can replace:

* Library path: `external/sdl3/build/RelWithDebInfo` with `usr/include/SDL3` (or wherever you have the SDL3 headers installed)
* Include path: `external/sdl3/include` with `usr/local/lib` (or wherever you have the SDL3 libraries installed)

If you're using CMake, simply set the `USE_VENDORED_SDL3` to `OFF` during the configure step:

```console
> cmake -DUSE_VENDORED_SDL3=OFF -B build/ -G "Visual Studio 17 2022"
```

## Current limitations

* No alpha compositing
* No multi-threading/SIMD
* Support only a subset of the OBJ specification
